## Introduction

As the software landscape continues to evolve, ensuring code originality and preventing plagiarism has become increasingly important. The Transformer-based C/C++ Code Plagiarism Detector offers a robust solution for detecting instances of code similarity, whether they involve direct copy-pasting or modified code clones. The tool capitalizes on the proven effectiveness of the Transformer architecture, which has demonstrated exceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and text classification.

## Features

- **State-of-the-Art Detection:** Leverage a pre-trained Transformer model to encode C/C++ source code files into fixed-size vectors, capturing their semantic meanings.
- **Comprehensive Similarity Measures:** Utilize various similarity metrics, including cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity, to compare encoded code representations and identify potential similarities.
- **Detect Literal Copies and Code Clones:** Uncover both literal code copies and instances where code has been modified or restructured while maintaining substantial similarities.
- **Versatile File Format Support:** Process single code files or entire C/C++ source code projects, supporting a wide range of file formats.
- **Scalable for Large Codebases:** Analyze extensive codebases with confidence, as the detector's performance remains robust even when dealing with significant amounts of code.
- **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the detector into existing development environments or utilize it as a standalone tool, adapting to your workflow.
