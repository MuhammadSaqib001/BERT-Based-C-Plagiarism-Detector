Project Title :- Transformer based C/C++ Code Plagiarism Detector
Brief Description :-
The Transformer-based C/C++ Code Plagiarism Detector is a software tool
designed to detect plagiarism in C/C++ source code files using state-of-the-art
natural language processing techniques. The detector employs the Transformer
architecture, which has been proven highly effective in various natural language
processing tasks, such as machine translation and text classification.
The code plagiarism detector uses a pre-trained Transformer model to
encode the input source code files into fixed-size vectors, capturing their
semantic meanings. The encoded representations are then compared using
various similarity measures, such as cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity, to
identify potential code similarities. The detector is capable of detecting both literal
code copies and code clones, where the code has been slightly modified or
restructured.
The detector supports various file formats, including single code files of
C/C++ source code files. It can handle large codebases and can be easily
integrated into existing development environments or used as a standalone tool.
